support for the razer blade 15 base 2020 (late)
with usb id 1532:0268
make sure to change the kernel path in the makefile.
then run
`make driver_install` and get the latest polychromatic from git
i don't know what this razer shitshow can also do, was only targeting
the christmas light shitshow it's basicly only copying the 2020 early model's
config with the new usb id.
